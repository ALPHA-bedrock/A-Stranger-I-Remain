I've come here from nowhere
Across the unforgiving sea
Drifting further and further
It's all becoming clear to me
But violent winds are upon us and I can't sleep
Internal temperatures rising and all the voices won't recede
I've finally found what I was looking for
A place where I can be without remorse
Because I am a stranger who has found an even stranger war
I've finally found what I was looking for
